#7. *Problem: Dictionary Access*
#   Write a Python program that creates a dictionary with keys as weekdays (like 'Monday', 'Tuesday', etc.) and values as their corresponding numeric index (starting from 1 for 'Monday'). Prompt the user to enter a weekday and print its corresponding numeric index from the dictionary.

d = {
    "Monday": 1,
    "Tuesday": 2,
    "Wednesday": 3,
    "Thursday": 4,
    "Friday": 5,
    "Saturday": 6,
    "Sunday": 7
    
}
print(d)
  d = input("Enter a weekday: ")
